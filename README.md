# Http App - for calling BE Services

I made this project throughout React course for learning calling BE Api's at [Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com)

## Project Overview

- In this project, I've learned to call backend api's from [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) free api's.
- JSON placeholder gives us an API.
- This API consests of a few endpoints like this posts endpoint we have here:

- Using this endpoints we can send http requests to this endpoints, to create, read, update, and delete data. (CRUD Operations)
